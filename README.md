Source for [urbitdraw.com](http://urbitdraw.com/), a public webpage that lets Urbit users draw on a shared canvas. Users login in with either a running Urbit ship via eauth or with an Urbit ID via MetaMask. Planets draw on the bottom panel, stars on the middle, and galaxies on the top.

This is the first app to allow users to authenticate with their Urbit ID by connecting their wallet, and was a prototype for the types of interesting interactions that can arise when users only own Urbit IDs and don't need to have running ships of their own.
